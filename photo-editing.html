              <span>
                Harbinger of Fire is a custom level that I made for a rhythm
                video game called Project Arrhythmia. I made and animated all
                the visuals here using the level editor's selection of basic
                shapes (squares, circles, hexagons, etc.) and text elements. I
                even made the song myself.

            <span class="photo-editing-text25">
              For this level, I wanted to make sure that gameplay came first
              over the visuals. So, when designing the robots that come to
              attack you in this section, I designed them after the type of
              attack that they will unleash.
            </span>

            <span class="photo-editing-text26">
              <span>
                - The beam robots have their design built around a central heavy
                assault cannon, they fly in and unleash a devastating barrage in
                tandem with the song before dipping out.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                - The AOE (Area of Effect) robots are designed to look like
                undersea mines to convey their role in exploding. Their
                explosion is in a cross pattern, which is shown on the surface
                of their shell. I used them to explode with the intense notes in
                this part of the song.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                - And finally, the melee drones are simple darts with a big
                buzzsaw attached to the front, their arrow design reflects their
                speed, and the buzzsaw reflects their lethality. They are used
                to scrape the edges of the screen whenever the song transitions,
                or whenever I needed to prevent the player from hiding in the
                corners.

            <span class="photo-editing-text34">
              I was having trouble making fun gameplay for the "curve" robot, so
              I decided to redesign it as a larger machine instead.
            </span>
            <img

              It "jumpscares" the player before firing a massive laser. The
              missile pods sticking out of its head were fired from the
              background a little earlier in the level. If you look closely, you
              can see it move back into the clouds before this "jumpscare"
              happens
            </span>

              alt="image"

            />
            <span class="photo-editing-text36">
              During the time of making this level, Project Arrhythmia's level
              editor was quite buggy and there were a lot of issues that I ran
              into during Harbinger of Fire's development. In this case, the
              layering started messing up and my player could clip underneath
              the shapes that make up the "beam" robot. By the way, each box
              that you can see on the timeline represents a SINGLE object, like
              a triangle or a circle. So in order to create these complex
              designs, I had to group shapes together to make more complex
              shapes out of them.
            </span>
            <img
              alt="image"

              class="photo-editing-image15"
            />
            <span class="photo-editing-text37">
              Speaking of the level editor, to create these complex animations,
              each object has 4 channels: Position, Scale, Rotation, and Color.
              You can create keyframes along these channels to change the state
              of one of these properties over time. You can set an easing type
              for each keyframe, to change the way an object will move from one
              state to the next. You can also group objects to a parent, and
              those grouped objects will inherit certain changes made to the
              parent such as the position or rotation.
            </span>
            <img
              alt="image"

              <span class="photo-editing-text39">
                I did a lot of careful planning when making this level. For
                example, this game only allows NINE possible color channels at
                any given point, so I need to plan ahead and figure out what
                colors I'll need to use before I start making things in the
                editor. (NOTE: There are low-opacity objects that you can place
                down that allow you to create different color values by stacking
                these transparent objects on top of one another)

              The Indomitable Spirit is the "miniboss" that you face at the end
              of the level. It is also the most ambitious thing I've made in
              Project Arrhythmia's editor.

              When designing the indomitable spirit, I initially set out to
              create a Biblically-accurate angel. However, in an effort to push
              myself, I wanted to create something even more complicated, as it
              had become a meme within the community that the only boss designs
              that people make are levitating faces with two disembodied hands.

            />
            <span class="photo-editing-text45">
              Because the level editor only gives you a set of basic shapes to
              work with, I had to plan out what shapes I needed to use to create
              the Indomitable Spirit's human-like appearance and proportions.
            </span>

              <span>
                While this seems like a lot of objects, apparently people within
                the game community consider this to be quite "optimized"; that
                is, it only uses as many objects as it needs
              </span>
              <span class="photo-editing-text48">,</span>
              <span>
                so therefore it saves performance and prevents framerates from
                dropping further than they need to.

            <span class="photo-editing-text50">
              This animation was made possible by linking up all the different
              objects that make up the Indomitable Spirit into groups that make
              up each segment of the torso, starting at the base.

              Think of it like a skeletal system, but instead of an actual rig
              it is made up of chained parent groups. When I rotate the "Tummy"
              bone, everything connected to it from the Ribcage onwards will be
              influenced by the rotation. (NOTE: The neck and head are separate
              from the rest of the body, because for some reason it was having
              issues when moving with the the body, so I had to animate it
              independently)

                Designing and animating the attacks for this sequence was a lot
                of fun but also a lot of work. I wanted to give the Indomitable
                Spirit a sense of sheer power, so I made these attacks as
                over-the-top as possible:
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                - The Spirit breaks the chains that bind it, detonating the
                walls and sending sparks flying.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                - The Spirit regenerates its amputated limbs, while overflowing
                with so much energy that lightning pours out of its chest,
                before striking down at the edges of the screen.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                - The Spirit winds up and lands a devastating punch into the
                center of the screen. This sends the camera flying backwards and
                the Spirit gives chase.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                - The Spirit catches up, grabs the screen and throws it out of
                the door that kept it sealed inside.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                These are just a handful of the attacks that the Indomitable
                Spirit does. It could've been a lot harder but thanks to my
                proper "bone" setup I was able to move the rig around with ease.

                Keep in mind that all these animations may look a little fast
                because they had to be in-sync with the music, since Project
                Arrhythmia is a rhythm game after all.
