                Dualbeat is an upcoming Rhythm game I've been on-and-off working
                on with my friend since October 2023. It is a simple but tricky
                rhythm game about coordination between two shapes. Coming soon
                to steam for free!

            <span class="art-text19">
              There were a lot of things that I worked on for the game, as my
              friend took care of all the coding work, I covered all the visual
              and auditory elements.

              Dualbeat's design philosophy is red on left, blue on right. This
              extends to almost every design in the game, from the logo artwork
              all the way to the backgrounds. The reason for this is because the
              gameplay is tied to both of your hands, where your right hand
              controls a blue square and your left hand controls a red circle.
              When playtesting this game in the early stages of development,
              myself and others were having a hard time distinguishing which
              shape and which color corresponded with which hand, so by
              integrating this design into the visuals, one could take a glance
              at the background and remember that red is left, blue is
              right.&nbsp;

              Dualbeat uses retro pixel graphics as a design choice. However,
              most of the pixel art you see wasn't created the traditional way,
              but instead "faked" using vectors.

              These vectors were created and then animated using Moho 14.5 Pro.

            <span class="art-text24">
              I use vectors because they speed up the animation process greatly
              and help maintain consistent proportions. They also allow me to
              reuse the same model for different animations. (and sometimes the
              same animation for different models)

            <span class="art-text25">
              When I'm done, I render the vector model as a low resolution and
              turn off antialiasing. This results in a crisp, retro look.

                Because Dualbeat is a rhythm game, each sprite (or referred
                in-game as a prop) typically consists of at lest an idle
                animation loop and a "pulse" animation. Pulses can be set to
                play once on a specific instrument or beat, and then the prop
                will return to the idle animation afterwards.

              In Dualbeat, one of the main features is the level editor. While
              not all the icons are in place yet, all the buttons and other
              graphical UI textures were designed and put into place by me.

                I made sure that the UI textures were visually distinct,
                provided plenty visual feedback, and were fun to interact with.

                These buttons here have shading on them to make it seem like

                3D effect.
